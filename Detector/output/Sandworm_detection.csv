18,DETAILSThe following account of events is based on the interagency team’s interviews with operations and information technology staff and leadership at six Ukrainian organizations with first-hand experience of the event.,1.0,0.9734
19,"Following these discussions and interviews, the team assesses that the outages experienced on December 23, 2015, were caused by external cyber-attackers.",1.0,0.9847
20,"The team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyber-attack; however, a significant number of independent reports from the team’s interviews as well as documentary findings corroborate the events as outlined below.",1.0,0.9937
21,"Through interviews with impacted entities, the team learned that power outages were caused by remote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies (Oblenergos) impacting approximately 225,000 customers.",1.0,0.9789
22,"While power has been restored, all the impacted Oblenergos continue to run under constrained operations.",1.0,0.9497
23,"In addition, three other organizations, some from other critical infrastructure sectors, were also intruded upon but did not experience operational impacts  The cyber-attack was reportedly synchronized and coordinated, probably following extensive reconnaissance of the victim networks.",1.0,0.9599
24,"According to company personnel, the cyber-attacks at each company occurred within 30 minutes of each other and impacted multiple central and regional facilities.",1.0,0.9147
25,"During the cyber-attacks, malicious remote operation of the breakers was conducted by multiple external humans using either existing remote administration tools at the operating system level or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software via virtual private network (VPN) connections.",1.0,0.9828
26,The companies believe that the actors acquired legitimate credentials prior to the cyber-attack to facilitate remote access.,1.0,0.9796
27,All three companies indicated that the actors wiped some systems by executing the KillDisk malware at the conclusion of the cyber-attack.,1.0,0.9797
28,"The KillDisk malware erases selected files on target systems and corrupts the master boot record, rendering systems inoperable.",1.0,0.9433
29,"It was further reported that in at least one instance, Windows-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs) embedded in remote terminal units were also overwritten with KillDisk.",1.0,0.6036
30,The actors also rendered Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations inoperable by corrupting their firmware.,1.0,0.9317
31,"In addition, the actors reportedly scheduled disconnects for server Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) via the UPS remote management interface.",1.0,0.9631
32,The team assesses that these actions were done in an attempt to interfere with expected restoration efforts.,1.0,0.9822
33,Each company also reported that they had been infected with BlackEnergy malware however we do not know whether the malware played a role in the cyber-attacks.,1.0,0.9508
34,The malware was reportedly delivered via spear phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments.,1.0,0.9623
35,"It is suspected that BlackEnergy may have been used as an initial access vector to acquire legitimate credentials; however, this information is still being evaluated.",1.0,0.7328
36,It is important to underscore that any remote access Trojan could have been used and none of BlackEnergy’s specific capabilities were reportedly leveraged.,1.0,0.7466
37,"MITIGATIONThe first, most important step in cybersecurity is implementation of information resources management best practices.",1.0,0.6374
38,Key examples include: procurement and licensing of trusted hardware and software systems; knowing who and what is on your network through hardware and software asset management automation; on time patching of systems; and strategic technology refresh.,1.0,0.8228
39,Organizations should develop and exercise contingency plans that allow for the safe operation or shutdown of operational processes in the event that their ICS is breached.,1.0,0.9605
40,These plans should include the assumption that the ICS is actively working counter to the safe operation of the process.,1.0,0.9773
41,ICS-CERT recommends that asset owners take defensive measures by leveraging best practices to minimize the risk from similar malicious cyber activity.,1.0,0.9251
42,Application Whitelisting (AWL) can detect and prevent attempted execution of malware uploaded by malicious actors.,1.0,0.7605
43,"The static nature of some systems, such as database servers and HMI computers, make these ideal candidates to run AWL.",1.0,0.9149
44,"Operators are encouraged to work with their vendors to baseline and calibrate AWL deployments.NCCIC/ICS-CERT, Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf, web site last accessed February 25, 2016.",1.0,0.9026
45,"Organizations should isolate ICS networks from any untrusted networks, especially the Internet.",1.0,0.9375
46,All unused ports should be locked down and all unused services turned off.,1.0,0.7524
47,"If a defined business requirement or control function exists, only allow real-time connectivity to external networks.",1.0,0.8388
48,"If one-way communication can accomplish a task, use optical separation (“data diode”).",1.0,0.8627
49,"If bidirectional communication is necessary, then use a single open port over a restricted network path.aOrganizations should also limit Remote Access functionality wherever possible.",1.0,0.8832
50,Modems are especially insecure.,1.0,0.8031
51,"Users should implement “monitoring only” access that is enforced by data diodes, and do not rely on “read only” access enforced by software configurations or permissions.",1.0,0.8173
52,Remote persistent vendor connections should not be allowed into the control network.,1.0,0.9537
53,"Remote access should be operator controlled, time limited, and procedurally similar to “lock out, tag out.” The same remote access paths for vendor and employee connections can be used; however, double standards should not be allowed.",1.0,0.9295
54,"Strong multi-factor authentication should be used if possible, avoiding schemes where both tokens are similar types and can be easily stolen (e.g., password and soft certificate).aAs in common networking environments, control system domains can be subject to a myriad of vulnerabilities that can provide malicious actors with a “backdoor” to gain unauthorized access.",1.0,0.9627
55,"Often, backdoors are simple shortcomings in the architecture perimeter, or embedded capabilities that are forgotten, unnoticed, or simply disregarded.",1.0,0.9074
56,Malicious actors often do not require physical access to a domain to gain access to it and will usually leverage any discovered access functionality.,1.0,0.857
57,"Modern networks, especially those in the control systems arena, often have inherent capabilities that are deployed without sufficient security analysis and can provide access to malicious actors once they are discovered.",1.0,0.9531
58,"These backdoors can be accidentally created in various places on the network, but it is the network perimeter that is of greatest concern.",1.0,0.9657
59,"When looking at network perimeter components, the modern IT architecture will have technologies to provide for robust remote access.",1.0,0.9399
60,"These technologies often include firewalls, public facing services, and wireless access.",1.0,0.7544
61,Each technology will allow enhanced communications in and amongst affiliated networks and will often be a subsystem of a much larger and more complex information infrastructure.,1.0,0.9026
62,"However, each of these components can (and often do) have associated security vulnerabilities that an adversary will try to detect and leverage.",1.0,0.8281
63,"Interconnected networks are particularly attractive to a malicious actor, because a single point of compromise may provide extended access because of pre-existing trust established among interconnected resources.NCCIC/ICS-CERT, Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf , web site last accessed February 25, 2016.",1.0,0.9757
